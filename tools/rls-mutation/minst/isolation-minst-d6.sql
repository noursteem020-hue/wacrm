-- Proves account isolation through the real RLS policies.
-- Not a vitest file: the repo's unit tests mock Supabase, and a mocked
-- RLS assertion proves nothing — the mock would BE the assertion.
-- Run against local Supabase Postgres:
--   docker exec -i supabase_db_wacrm psql -U postgres -d postgres -f - \
--     < src/lib/tenant/isolation.sql
--
-- The predicate under test is exactly the one on every data table:
--     is_account_member(account_id)
-- which resolves the caller through profiles.user_id = auth.uid().
-- Nothing reads a request header to decide the account.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- EXIT CODE IS THE RESULT. THIS SCRIPT HAS A GATE.
--
--   exit 0 = every assertion below held
--   exit 3 = at least one assertion failed. psql exits 3 when ON_ERROR_STOP is
--            on and a statement raises.
--
-- Sections 1-6 are INFORMATIONAL CENSUS: they print, they never judge. Their
-- output is not a verdict and must not be read as one — a census row reading
-- "is_account_member" states which policy text exists, not that RLS works.
-- The gate is sections 7-9b, which push real traffic through the real policies.
--
-- WHY NOT \quit: measured on this container, `\quit 7` exits 0 (psql warns
-- "extra argument ignored" and drops it). The only measured mechanism that
-- yields a non-zero exit is a raised error with ON_ERROR_STOP on -> exit 3.
-- So the gate is a RAISE EXCEPTION synthesised at the end of the file.
--
-- NOTHING IS COMMITTED. Every mutating block is BEGIN ... ROLLBACK, so the
-- script leaves zero rows behind and is safe to run twice in a row. Row-level
-- security state and policies are read, never changed.

--   A re-points its OWN row at account B               -> REJECTED_RLS rows=0

--   in-place edit of A's own row again, AFTER the negatives -> ALLOWED rows=1
--
-- WHICH POLICY ACTUALLY BLOCKS IT -- measured, do not assume. The 42501 on the
-- cross-account move comes from the contacts_SELECT policy, not from
-- contacts_update. Proof, each in its own rolled-back transaction:
--   contacts_update USING is_account_member WITH CHECK (true)   -> still 42501
--   contacts_update USING (true) WITH CHECK (true)              -> still 42501
--   contacts_update USING (true) AND contacts_select dropped    -> ALLOWED
-- The reason is that an UPDATE's row scan is filtered by the SELECT policy: an
-- UPDATE reads candidate rows through the SELECT USING, so the post-image check
-- never gets to admit a row the caller cannot see. This is why replacing the
-- implicit WITH CHECK with WITH CHECK (true) -- the obvious UPDATE-hole mutation --
-- does NOT go red, and why that must not be this section's target.
--
-- The mutation that DOES open the hole, measured exit 3 with the failures named
-- [9a] FAIL cross-account UPDATE was ALLOWED and [9a] FAIL ... left 2 row(s) owned
-- by account B: contacts_select USING (true) TOGETHER WITH contacts_update USING
-- (true). contacts_update USING (true) ALONE stays green (exit 0) and deletes
-- nothing, because contacts_select still scopes the scan.
--
-- Both shapes are measured because a restriction can hold for the targeted form
-- and not the unscoped one, and the unscoped form is the realistic attack.
--
-- The rows are targeted by PHONE, not by account_id, and ownership is asserted by
-- comparing the account_id COLUMN after the write. The marker names which rows are
-- probe rows and nothing else.
--
-- WHY RESET ROLE INSIDE THE BLOCK, THEN COUNT AT TOP LEVEL: the counts must be read
-- as postgres. Counting as anon after a write reads 0 for the other account's row
-- whether it survived or was destroyed, because anon cannot SEE it -- so an as-anon
-- count cannot distinguish a clean deny from a full wipe. Measured in this file's
-- own 9b/9a blocks:
--   probe rows visible to anon after the DELETE shapes -> 0   (looks clean either way)
--   probe rows counted AS POSTGRES                      -> 3, and B's row still there
-- RESET ROLE restores postgres for the statements that follow the DO block
